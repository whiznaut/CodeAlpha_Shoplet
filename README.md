# Shoplet E-Commerce Project
## Project Overview

Shoplet is a basic e-commerce web application developed as part of my Full Stack Developer Internship at CodeAlpha. The primary goal of this project was to create a functional online store with core e-commerce features like product listing, cart management, and order processing.

## Key Features

- **Product Listing:** Users can browse through various products displayed on the homepage, each accompanied by an image, name, price, and an "Add to Cart" button.

- **Product Details Modal:** Clicking on a product opens a detailed modal, providing an in-depth view of the product, including its description and reviews. The modal also includes an "Add to Cart" button for convenience.

- **Cart Management:** 
  - Users can add products to their cart from the homepage or product details modal.
  - The cart page displays all items added to the cart with options to increase/decrease quantity or remove items.
  - The cart also features a summary section showing the total amount and a button to proceed to checkout.

- **Persistent Cart:** The cart's contents are stored in the user's local storage, ensuring that the cart is maintained even if the user refreshes the page or revisits later.

- **Checkout Process:** 
  - The checkout page includes a form to collect user details such as name, address, email, and phone number.
  - Upon form submission, the order is processed and saved, and the user receives a confirmation that the purchase was successful.
  - The cart is cleared after the order is completed.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Backend:** Express.js, Node.js
- **Database:** MongoDB
- **Deployment:** Local environment
